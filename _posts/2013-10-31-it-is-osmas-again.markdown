It's OSAMS again and as i did [last year][1] i will donate time to open source projects that helped me to get my work done and also help projects that i find interesting.

As last year i started to take vacation of fridays in november and december and so i try to spend at least the 6 fridays as full work days to open source development, bug fixing, documentation writing.

If you know projects that need help just write me a message at [github][2] or [twitter][3].
Projects written in PHP and/or JavaScript will be preffered.

I will tweet about my work with the hashtag [#osmas][4].

I hope some of you will also donate some time to your favorite open source projects and maybe get involved in to one and spend time during the whole year on open source development.
