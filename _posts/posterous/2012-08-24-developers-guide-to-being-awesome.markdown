## I am awesome!

why am i awesome?


#### i am a developer!

* I create great stuff out of nothing
* I bring order to chaos (sometimes also the other way around)
* I tell the machines what they must do


#### i like developing

* its not a 9to5 job for me
* its more like getting paid for my hobby :D
* i want to be better.
* i read
* i go to user groups
* i go to conferences
* i watch conference streams/videos
* i want that my colleges/programmer friends also get better
* when i get new information or find a new cool project
* i try to get my programmer friend or colleges to also read/watch over it - because they have maybe another point of view to new ideas/project and talk with them helps me to be even more awesome and as side-effect there awesomelevel also grows ;)


Thats why i am really awesome.

* are you also awesome?
* do you wane be awesome?

### What do you need to become as awesome as i am?

at first grow your self a beard - but i think this is some sort of optional.

#### READ!

* if you dont do this already, read, read alot.
* read on a daily base and try to find new information.
* read blogs
* read books - clean code is an awsome book
* read sourcecode - getting his head around other projects is really cool

#### WRITE!

* write code
* write good code
* write bad code
* just write code and think about it
* refactor it, delete it, start over
* also some cool stuff are code katas, small lessons that can be mostly done in 15-50, minutes to just trani your brain for all the standard problems

#### TALK!

* go to usergroups
  * its not just because of the talks
  * its also because of the pauses, the talks between people
  * try to get your coworkers to also go to user groups, its more fun for you and maybe they also learn new stuff
* go to conferences
  * ok there are not really cheap, but look out for unconferences like the php unconference in hamburg or the cheap ones like the froscon
  * on conferences its also a lot about socailising and talking to other developers, but this is also a very good point of learnign and getting/sharing information

#### SHARE!

* When you find great information share it with your collegs/code friends
* When you wrote some awesome pice of code put it, when possible, as open Source and let everyone use it
* When you have great ideas share them in a talk in a usergroup or on a conference.
