As the 29th of May is a Bankholiday and a Thursday here in Germany. I did what every good german would do, i took a [Br√ºckentag][1] and now i have a 4 Days weekend.

I will spend the most of this Weekend on [P2EE][2] projects to get a release of the [Perparables][3] and [Partlets][4] project out to the world.

And as we all know that hacking on projects is more fun in a group, i try to gather some other PHP Hackers for hacking together on projects.
